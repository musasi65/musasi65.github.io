    <p>To set the mood, the restaurant looks like a gingerbread house found in the small botanical garden in the city centre of Antwerp. Van Damme takes deserts and sweet dishes to a new level and got rewarded for this with a first Michelin star in November 2010. This young chef has also a soft spot for Japan. It all began when he first visited Tokyo for a culinary get-together with ex-El Bulli chefs from around the world. Tokyoites can savour Van Damme's creations in the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/tokyo/">Four Seasons Marunouchi</a> in Ginza or buy his cakes at the <a href="http://www.takasebussan.co.jp/"><em>Takase Bussan</em></a> department stores in Japan. When in Antwerp, try his sweet version of tempura of orange while sipping from a glass of excellent wine. In the end, it's all about living the sweet life, isn't it.</p>
